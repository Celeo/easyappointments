# easyappointments-docker

Basically a modified fork of [alextselegidis/easyappointments-docker](https://github.com/alextselegidis/easyappointments-docker) with [alextselegidis/easyappointments](https://github.com/alextselegidis/easyappointments) cloned and modified into a subdirectory.

Both Easy!Appointments and its Docker setup repo are licensed under GPL v3.0. In compliance with that licensing requirement, so this the code here.
